# PortfolioProjects
Hello and welcome to my data science portfolio! 

This repository contains a collection of projects that showcase my skills and experience in data analysis, machine learning, and data exploration and visualization using SQL, Python, and R.

Each project includes a detailed README file that provides a brief summary of the project goals and implementation details, as well as the relevant datasets and any external resources used in the analysis. 
Additionally, the code is fully documented and follows best practices.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio.
