# COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to explore the COVID-19 dataset from Our World in Data using SQL. 
The dataset has been divided into three tables: Country_info, Covid_info, and Vaccine_info. The project aims to answer the following questions:

- What is the global trend of COVID-19 infections, deaths, and vaccinations over time?
- Which countries have been most affected by COVID-19 in terms of infections and deaths?
- How does COVID-19 impact different age groups and genders?
- How do vaccination rates correlate with COVID-19 infection and death rates?

## Implementation Details

The project uses SQL queries to extract and analyze data from the three tables:

- Country_info Table: contains all the column related to the various countries like population, life expectancy, gdp and so on
- Covid_info Table: contains all the columns related to infections, covid tests and deaths
- Vaccine_info Table: contains all the columns on vaccinations

## Conclusion

The project has successfully explored the COVID-19 dataset using SQL queries and provided insights into the global impact of COVID-19. Overall, this project provides a comprehensive view of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on different countries
