# Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease Data Exploration with R

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to explore the Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle, which contains information on the health status of 400k US adults, 
collected through the annual CDC survey. The aim of the project is to analyze the data and identify key indicators of heart disease.

The analysis was conducted using R programming language, along with various packages such as dplyr, ggplot2, and scale.

## Implementation Details

The project uses R to perform data exploration and analysis on the dataset. The following steps were taken:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation: The raw data was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. Data Exploration: The cleaned data was analyzed using various statistical techniques to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in the data.
3. Data visualization: The results were visualized using various charts and graphs to make it easier to interpret the findings.

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains 18 variables, including demographic information such as age, gender, race, alcohol and smoking habits, as well as health-related variables
such as body mass index, mental and physical health, and whether the individual has been diagnosed with heart disease.

## Conclusion

The analysis showed that certain demographic and health-related factors, such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and smoking status, 
were strongly associated with the likelihood of heart disease.
